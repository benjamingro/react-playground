# React Playground

This is my very first React project. It was created for the following purposes. 

* As a playground to help me learn React
* As a repository to showcase my React skills and capabilities along my learning journey
* As a location to put my self-learning assignments for the MIT xPRO coursework 
 
This project is viewable in a web browser courtesy of [GitHub Pages](https://benjamingro.github.io/react-playground/).
